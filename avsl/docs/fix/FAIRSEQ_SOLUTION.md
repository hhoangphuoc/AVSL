# Fairseq Import Issue - Solution Summary

## Problem
Your Whisper-Flamingo training was failing with:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'metrics' from 'fairseq' (unknown location)
```

This occurred because of circular import dependencies in fairseq when using:
```python
from fairseq import checkpoint_utils, utils
```

## Root Cause
The fairseq library has circular import issues where importing `checkpoint_utils` and `utils` directly triggers a chain of imports that eventually tries to import `metrics` from the main fairseq module, creating a circular dependency.

## Solution
**Path-Based Approach**: Make the fairseq installation properly visible to the training script by adding the correct paths to `sys.path` and pre-importing fairseq modules.

### Implementation
**Modified `avsl/whisper_flamingo_ft_ami.py`**: Added proper path setup and fairseq pre-loading:
```python
# Ensure fairseq is properly accessible by adding the fairseq installation path
fairseq_path = os.path.join(av_hubert_path, 'fairseq')
if os.path.exists(fairseq_path) and fairseq_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, fairseq_path)
    print(f"✓ Added fairseq path to sys.path: {fairseq_path}")

# Pre-import fairseq to ensure it's loaded correctly
try:
    import fairseq
    print(f"✓ Fairseq imported successfully from: {fairseq.__file__}")
    # Verify that the required modules are accessible
    _ = fairseq.checkpoint_utils
    _ = fairseq.utils
    print("✓ Fairseq checkpoint_utils and utils are accessible")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Warning: Fairseq import issue: {e}")
```

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **No changes** to the original Whisper-Flamingo repository
2. **Clean and simple** - just adds the correct paths to make fairseq visible
3. **Reliable** - ensures fairseq is properly loaded before any imports
4. **Minimal code changes** - only a few lines added to your training script
5. **No file modifications** - works entirely through Python path management

## Verification
✅ Whisper-Flamingo imports successfully  
✅ AudioEncoder with AV-HuBERT support works  
✅ Training script imports without errors  
✅ Original repository remains completely unchanged  

## Usage
Your training script now automatically sets up the correct paths for fairseq. Simply run:
```bash
sbatch avsl/scripts/whisper_flamingo_ft.sh
```

The script will verify fairseq accessibility and then run the training.

## Files Modified
- `avsl/whisper_flamingo_ft_ami.py` (minimal path setup changes)
- `avsl/scripts/whisper_flamingo_ft.sh` (updated with fairseq verification)

## Files Preserved
- `whisper_flamingo/` (original repository completely unchanged)
- All original Whisper-Flamingo code remains intact
